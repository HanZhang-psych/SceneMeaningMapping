# SceneMeaningMapping
Scene patches generated from stimuli in a scene perception task based on methods in Henderson & Hayes (2017). The patches were then used to build meaning maps using methods described in their paper.

* `code`: code to construct meaning maps from rating data
* `data`: contains raw data and end results
* `patch_stimuli`: scene patches as rating material
* `scene_images`: full images
* `surveys`: text surveys readable by Qualtrics
